# VoxelWars
Experiments with voxels in C#. Written using OpenTK and modern OpenGL. Mostly aimed for me to learn some basic rendering/game dev techniques.

## Planned features
 - Basic physics engine (collisions, bouncing, etc...)
 - Some multiplayer aspect

## Todo List

### Rendering
 - Generate meshes on separate thread
 - Merge voxels together: mesh simplification
 - Instancing?
 - Use interpolation to render smoother terrain (http://jamie-wong.com/2014/08/19/metaballs-and-marching-squares/)

### Gameplay
 - Water (flowing, pressure, etc...)
 - Physics
 - Explosions
